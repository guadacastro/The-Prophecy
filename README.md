# The-Prophecy 

Your eyes snap open, heart pounding. The dream... it felt so real.
Fragments of the vision flash through your mind:

A dragon's roar echoing across a ravaged kingdom...
A sword, pulsing with ethereal light, hidden in shadow...
An amulet, between flowers with ancient magic...
Flames licking at your heels as you face an immense, scaled beast...

As the last wisps of the dream fade, a voice resonates in your mind:
"Hero, your destiny awaits in the Town Square. Gather what you need, face your fears, and fulfill the prophecy."

You will need some weapon and amulet to win.
If you die, you will wake up at Time Square again.
