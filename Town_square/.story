Your eyes snap open, heart pounding. 
The dream... it felt so real. 
Fragments of the vision flash through your mind:

A dragon's roar echoing across a ravaged kingdom... 
A sword, shining with ethereal light... 
An excuisite armor, hidden in a dark dungeon...
Flames licking at your heels as you face an immense, scaled beast..

As the last wisps of the dream fade, a voice resonates in your mind: "Hero, your destiny awaits. Go, fulfill the prophecy. The country needs you..."

The Town Square is busy. 
As you look around, you see a sign, showing directions.
Outskirts,
Forest,
Mountains,
Castle

You are deciding where to go next.
