The castle is partially in ruin and the temperature here is higher than everywhere else.
As you walk towards it, you see a dragon high above, circling around and defending his territory.

The dragon descends, shaking the ground as he roars. 
You grip your sword, dodging flames as his claws tear the earth.
You can feel the heat of his breath as he spews fire, narrowly missing you...

...You leap over his tail, dodging another strike, and see your chance. 
With one final thrust, manage to defeat him. 
The dragon collapses. 
Exhausted but victorious, you stand over his fallen body, the battle won.
